  <p class="staffBio">
  <p>Built on the lead of its president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia has played a lead role in recent years to realise the water and sanitation elements of the Millennium Development goals. In 2010, an initial version of FLOW was used to map the status of 10,000 water points in the country in partnership with WSP (World Bank) and UNICEF. In 2012, Akvo signed a cooperation agreement to develop the WASH Liberia portal for the government. Akvo RSR will be used to bring the water project portfolio in Liberia online and is assisting in the establishment of a water monitoring unit in the government. The new version of Akvo FLOW will be used to conduct a follow-on mapping exercise with the goal of introducing continuous monitoring. This programme is supported by UNICEF.</p>

  <p class="staffBio"> The UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education is an international institute for water education that was established in 2003. It is working together with Akvo to engage the global network of more than 14,000 alumni who today work actively on water and sanitation project around the world. The UNESCO-IHE logo is now featured on water bottles being sold by Earth Water, with all profits being used to fund projects featured on Akvo.org. Our common goals are to use Akvo.org to help alumni match projects with funds and share progress and impact online, and encourage editor contributions to the Akvopedia. </p>

  <p class="staffTitle">Investing in Akvo FLOW</p>
  <p class="staffBio"> The Kenneth L. Harder Trust is a US philanthropic foundation that was established to invest in progressive and innovative initiatives. In summer 2013, a grant of $300,000 was made to Akvo specifically to fund the continuing development of the Akvo FLOW software platform. This builds on an earlier grant to Water for People, the initiator of FLOW, that has supported its work in Bolivia. </p>
