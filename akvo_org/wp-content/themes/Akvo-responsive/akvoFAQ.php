<h2>About the Akvo Foundation</h2>
      <h3 id="word">What does the word ‘Akvo’ mean?</h3>
      <p>Akvo means ‘water’ in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto language</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="whenfounded">When was Akvo founded and by whom?</h3>
      <p>The Akvo Foundation was formally incorporated in September 2008, but work started on Akvo in autumn 2006. Akvo was founded by the Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP) and several key individuals. People who played a key role at the start were Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson, Jeroen van der Sommen (Director of NWP), Peter van der Linde, Gino Lee, Mark Charmer, Gabriel von Heijne, Mark Nitzberg, Caroline Figuères, and Paul van Koppen.</p>
      <h3 id="anbi">Does Akvo have ANBI status? Are my donations tax deductable?</h3>
      <p>Akvo Foundation is a non-profit foundation with Dutch <a href="http://www.anbi.nl/index.php?id=&amp;let=A">ANBI status</a>. This means, among other things, that in the Netherlands donors to Akvo can deduct their gifts from income or corporation tax. Akvo is also registered as a non-profit in the United States (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)">501c3 status</a>).</p>
      <p><img src="/web/sites/default/files/logo_anbi.gif" /></p>
      <h3 id="whataccomplish">What is Akvo trying to accomplish?</h3>
      <p>Akvo seeks to accelerate the implementation process and improve the quality of development aid projects. We do this by providing internet tools that make it easier for people to do their work and share their results. Our tools include a knowledge bank called Akvopedia; a market of projects needing funds called the Akvo Marketplace; and a feedback and reporting system called Really Simple Reporting (RSR).</p>
      <h3 id="whofunds">Who funds Akvo?</h3>
      <p>Akvo received initial funds for startup from a number of different partners: NWP, Partners voor Water, Nedap, Aqua4all, ASN Bank, Simavi, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Schoklandfonds, Rabobank, Unie van Waterschappen. We have also received in-kind contributions from IRC, ProWeb and SIWI. In November 2010, as part of its MFSII funding announcement, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that around €100 million worth of development aid projects will be reported via Akvo system over a five year period. The operational revenues related to this service agreement mean that Akvo is now financially self-sustaining, a key objective of our business plan.</p>
      <h3 id="whoworks">Who works at Akvo?</h3>
      <p>The Akvo <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/team">team</a> and its volunteers are as diverse as the people we serve, spanning at least one ocean, a couple of continents, and several countries. </p>
      <h3 id="whopartners">Who are Akvo’s partners?</h3>
      <p>Akvo works with hundreds of <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partners">different organisations</a>, from NGOs to commercial enterprises, knowledge institutions to funding partners.</p>
      <h3 id="whoowns">Who owns Akvo?</h3>
      <p>Akvo is a non-profit foundation, and as such is owned by no one. It is, however, accountable to a Board drawn from ITC, development organisations and banks. The tools we produce are released under an <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/open_license/">open source license</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="cantrust">Can I trust Akvo?</h3>
      <p>Trust is very important to Akvo. We are careful about who we put ours in, and view the trust that others put in us as a serious responsibility. We are carefully building out our "trusted partner network" using a  thorough vetting process, adding new Support partners who already have a track record in development aid work (see <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules"> the Akvo partner rules</a>). As Support partners bring Field partners they currently work with into the system, our total network can expand and reach farther.</p>
      <p>We are as open as possible about what we do, in both the creation of our tools and the financing that supports it. Our accounts are audited every year by independent public accountants, and the reports are published on our website. </p>
      <h3 id="businessmodel">What is the business model of Akvo?</h3>
      <p>We charge a <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/fees/">service fee</a> to our partners who use Akvo RSR and related tools such as the Akvo Marketplace; access to the Akvopedia is free of charge. We also provide consultancy services and work with companies' Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.</p>
      <h3 id="commercial">Is Akvo a commercial company?</h3>
      <p>No, we're a non-profit foundation. Our goal is to be financially independent, offering a stable platform for users of our services.</p>
      <h3 id="smallprojects">Why does Akvo focus on relatively small projects?</h3>
      <p>Most people who lack access to water, sanitation, healthcare and education live in rural areas (<a href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp2008/en/index.html">WHO/Unicef study</a>). In such areas centralized systems are often not an option because of the distances involved. That is why large numbers of distributed systems are needed.</p>
      <p>Small-scale family or village-level systems which can be managed by the local community show great potential for filling this need. Such systems can be adapted to local circumstances, a task often undertaken by local NGOs who have an intimate knowledge of the situation and the local needs. Studies show that small projects also tend to be the most cost-effective.</p>
      <p>Such projects also offer the opportunity to create a direct link from the people in the field carrying out the project back to the people funding the project. </p>
      <h3 id="whywatsan">Why do the majority of your projects focus on water and sanitation?</h3>
      <p>Akvo was conceived in late 2006 to share knowledge about water and sanitation project best practice. Investments in water and sanitation are a highly effective means of alleviating poverty. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"No other single intervention is more likely to have a significant impact on global poverty than the provision of safe water."<br />
          <br />
          - C.J. Schuster-Wallace et al, United Nations University, "<a href="http://www.inweh.unu.edu/inweh/Health/2008PolicyBrief.pdf">Safe water as the key to global health</a>"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"...all water and sanitation improvements are cost-beneficial in all developing world sub-regions. In developing regions, the return on a US$1 investment was in the range of US$5 to US$46, depending on the intervention."<br />
          <br />
          - Hutton, G., Haller, L., and Bartram, J., WHO 2007, "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17878562">Global cost-benefit analysis of water supply and sanitation interventions</a>" </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In late 2010, we were happy to fulfill partner requests that we extend the system to support projects with other focus areas such as health, education and economic development.</p>
      <h3 id="whyaffordable">Why do you focus on simple and affordable technology?</h3>
      <p>The failure of many past projects in areas such as water and sanitation have been caused at least in part by the use of either technology that was too complex for the community to manage or so-called "appropriate technology" of low quality, and neither was properly adapted to the community. You have to get it just right. A recent study ("<a href="http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=17055IIED">Where every drop counts: tackling Africa's water crisis</a>", J. Skinner, IIDE, March 2009) shows what happens when the context in which you are embedding the technology is not taken into account from the start: in sub-Saharan Africa, a <i>quarter of a billion</i> dollars were wasted on non-sustainable water points.</p>
      <p>We believe part of the solution lies in low-cost, affordable and reparable technology, produced and mainta

<h2>Akvo activities and services</h2>
      <h3 id="whatoffer">Which services does Akvo offer?</h3>
      <p>Akvo offers three things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Akvopedia</b> - Online knowledge on low-cost, sustainable water and sanitation technology and approaches. Akvopedia works just like Wikipedia, anyone can edit it. </li>
        <li> <b>Akvo Marketplace</b> - a Marketplace for projects which are looking for funds. </li>
        <li> <b>Akvo Really Simple Reporting</b> - a project reporting and visualization system. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="whatbenefits">What are the benefits from using Akvo tools?</h3>
      <p>Akvo makes it easier to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Find projects to fund</b> - The Akvo Marketplace makes it clear where your money goes. When people or institutions fund Akvo projects, they are changing the lives of real people in real places. Funders choose the projects they want and watch progress unfold as the community teams share updates via SMS, photos and movie clips. </li>
        <li><b>Find donors to fund your project</b> - The Akvo Marketplace cuts bureaucracy and paperwork for NGOs around the world who today find it difficult to showcase projects and reach a wider audience of donors. Trusted partners can post projects in a simple manner without being forced through complex steps. Akvo makes it easier and quicker for you to find more funding with less technology investment. </li>
        <li><b>Report on project progress</b> - <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/faq_really_simple_reporting">Akvo Really Simple Reporting (RSR)</a> makes it easy for local communities and field teams to share short text updates, images and video clips, creating a positive feedback loop. Donors and fundraisers follow project progress online and can showcase storylines automatically in their own websites using <a href=#whatwidget>Akvo Widgets</a>. NGOs can work with more partners because we offer a common standard for project updates. </li>
        <li><b>Share water and sanitation knowledge</b> - Akvopedia works just like Wikipedia. It is filled with information on smart and affordable water and sanitation technology in rural or urban settings. Anyone can contribute knowledge and edit Akvopedia. Local field workers get access to new ideas for their projects, and can share knowledge in new ways. For those with good content but who are short of time to share it, Akvopedia offers free editorial services. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="howdifferent">How is Akvo different from other sites?</h3>
      <p>Akvo offers new tools that make it possible to implement development projects in a more efficient way and with a higher level of transparency than has been possible before. Akvo offers new ways of funding and reporting for projects, attracting money from new categories of donors.</p>
      <p>Akvo has placed special emphasis on the potential to improve access to water and sanitation, because investments in that area have been shown to be very effective in reducing poverty and promoting development. Because of the previous work experience of our staff, our network in the water and sanitation field is already very large. Having knowledge on water and sanitation in-house leads to much richer and effective relationship with our partners than a simple funding relationship would make possible.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, there is a real synergy between the Really Simple Reporting and the Akvopedia. The articles on technologies and approaches in Akvopedia act as inputs and inspiration for the projects, and the projects provide field experiences stories, acting as context for the Akvopedia articles.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Akvo tools which allow project updating through SMS make it possible to do project updating from places without internet access.</p>
      <h3 id="diverting">Isn't Akvo diverting funds away from important project work?</h3>
      <p>The start-up funding that Akvo has received would otherwise not have gone to projects in the field - it was specifically earmarked to explore innovative new ways of improving how water and sanitation projects are implemented.</p>
      <p>The goal is that with the help of Akvo tools, people are able to implement more projects with the same resources, and implement them more effectively.</p>
      <h3 id="whatakvopedia">What is Akvopedia?</h3>
      <p>Akvopedia works just like Wikipedia. It is filled with information on smart and affordable water and sanitation technology in rural or peri-urban settings. Anyone can contribute knowledge and edit Akvopedia. Local field workers get access to new ideas for their projects, and can share knowledge in new ways. For those with good content but who are short of time to share it, Akvopedia offers free editorial services.</p>
      <h3 id="whatmarketplace">What is the Akvo Marketplace?</h3>
      <p>It is a place to showcase development aid projects that are looking for funds. Organizations, companies and individuals who like the project can donate to a specific project. Akvo collects the funds and channels them to the project organization, sometimes through a Support partner. In this way, an individual project can attract funding from many different sources.</p>
      <p>A single project can appear on many different websites through the use of ‘widgets’: a section on a website (of a Funding partner, a school, an NGO, etc) which is filled with information from the Akvo website. See below at ‘<a href=#whatwidget>What is a Widget?</a>’</p>
      <h3 id="whatrsr">What is Akvo Realy Simple Reporting?</h3>
      <p>It is a web- and SMS-based reporting system that allows Field partners and communities that work on projects to easily share short text updates, images and movie clips. RSR is an easy and transparent way to track projects in the field on a regular basis, and to share and visualise results in an appealing way. One of the benefits is the increased transparency from publishing all the project details including funds, deliverables, and updates, on a freely accessible website.</p>
      <p>RSR does not create an additional layer of reporting. It is a tool that makes it possible to move some of the reporting that is already happening to a place where more people can follow it, and where it can be more useful. As the RSR tools are easy to use, this does not add an extra burden - on the contrary, it will safe time of field staff.</p>
      <p>Donors and fundraisers can follow project progress online and can showcase project developments automatically in their own websites using <a href=#whatwidget>Akvo Widgets</a>. NGOs can work with more partners because Akvo RSR offers a common standard for project updates.</p>

      <p><a href="/labs/index.php/Akvo_Phone">Akvo Phone</a> is the name of the Akvo mobile phone platform, which is currently under development. One of the components is Really Simple Reporting through SMS.</p>
      <h3 id="whatwidget">What is a widget?</h3>
      <p>A widget is an internet tool that allows you to embed information from the Akvo project webpages into other websites. Because the information comes from the Akvo system, it is automatically updated when a project changes, such as when there are new updates. It is like taking a YouTube movie and putting it on a website: if the YouTube movie changes, it changes on the website where it is embedded as well.</p>
      <p>A widget can show an individual project, or a random project from an organization, or a listing of all projects from an organization. As an example, see <a href="http://www.aquaforall.nl/">Aqua for All</a>, which has an Akvo widget on the left-hand side of the home page, and a <a href=" http://www.aquaforall.nl/content.asp?h=6&amp;s=85&amp;st=5">different widget here</a>, featuring a list of projects supported by Aqua for All.</p>
      <h3 id="howmany">How many organizations are using Akvo services?</h3>
      <p>You can see how many organizations are using the Akvo services by going to the Akvo partner pages at <a href="http://www.akvo.org/rsr/organizations/" title="http://www.akvo.org/rsr/organizations/">http://www.akvo.org/rsr/organizations/</a>, where they are all listed.</p>
      <h3 id="whatopensource">What does it mean that all the Akvo tools are open source?</h3>
      <p>It means that anyone can take the tools (Akvo Marketplace and Akvo Really Simple Reporting) we have build and reuse them for other purposes, such as, for example, fighting malaria, market approaches for the poor, or agriculture. The only thing we ask in return is that any improvements that are made to the tools are shared back, in the same way as we share the tools. For more information about the open source licenses used, see the <a href=http://www.akvo.org/web/open_license>Akvo Licenses and Copyright page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="ownversion">If Akvo's tools are open-source, can I set up my own version independently?</h3>
      <p>Yes you can. However, we think there is a big benefit for the development aid sector to have one open database in which knowledge and projects are collected. We provide a range of tools that make it easy for partners to feature projects on their own websites. We're also keen to bring online new features to help partners assert the unique identity and focus of their organisations, while maintaining the system as an open one where the emphasis is on collaboration between everyone.</p>

<h2>Akvo partners</h2>
      <h3 id="howparticipate">How can I participate in Akvo? </h3>
      <p>There are many ways in which people can participate in Akvo, depending on your situation. If you are an NGO, you may want to become a Support partner or Field partner, and use the Akvo platform for your work. If you are looking for funds, you might like the Akvo Marketplace. If you are a water and sanitation expert, you may be able to help us improve the knowledge on Akvopedia. If you are an IT specialist, you may want to help build the Akvo software platform, which is a joint open source effort. If you have money, you may want to fund a project. </p>
      <p>All the options of participating in Akvo are listed <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/get_involved">on this webpage</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="whatbenefits">What are the benefits of becoming an Akvo partner? </h3>
      <p>The benefits of becoming an Akvo partner are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By showcasing your projects on the Akvo Marketplace, you reach an audience around the world of potential donors. </li>
        <li>By using Akvo widgets, your project can appear on many other websites, such as partner organizations, school websites, etc. </li>
        <li>On the Akvo website, each project gets its own mini-website for showcasing the project, the background, photos, video’s, and project updates. </li>
        <li>Publishing visually appealing reporting and feedback to donors becomes easier using Akvo Really Simple Reporting. </li>
        <li>Because all details of the project are published on the Akvo website, the project funding and progress is transparent. </li>
        <li>Information in Akvo can be re-used in many flexible ways. </li>
        <li>Partners gain from having a single transparent database for projects, where many efforts can be viewed and compared, side by side. </li>
        <li>The freshest, state-of-the-art technology is always available to you. Akvo.org improves every month. </li>
        <li>Easy access through a web browser - no need to install any software. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="whopartner">Who can become an Akvo partner? </h3>
      <p>Organizations that work with small-scale water and sanitation projects in one of the following ways: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement projects with local communities </li>
        <li>Support local organizations with capacity building, knowledge transfer, or other support activities such as monitoring, education, etc. </li>
        <li>Fund projects </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="howpartner">How do I become a partner? </h3>
      <p>Depending on the size, location and activities of the organization, organizations may either become a <a href=#whatfield>Field partner</a>, a <a href=#whatsupport>Support partner</a> or a <a href=#whatfunding>Funding partner</a>. See the relevant section for what these types of partnerships entail, and for the procedure of becoming a partner in each case. The criteria, roles and responsibilities, and procedures are listed in full on the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules">Akvo partner rules page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="whatfield">What is a ‘Field partner’, and how do I become one? </h3>
      <p>Akvo Field partners implement the international development projects listed in Akvo, in collaboration with the local community. The Field partner has a local office. Organizations can become a Field partner with Akvo through the recommendation and support of a Support partner. The reason for this is that we feel that the quality of projects benefits significantly from the involvement of an experienced Support partner, which supports the field partner in carrying out the project.</p>
      <p>The best way to start is to contact one of the Akvo Support partners that you already have a link to, and ask them if they are willing to function as Support partner for your organization. The current Support partners are <a href="http://www.akvo.org/rsr/organisations/support/">listed here</a>. Please refer to the full list of criteria, roles and responsibilities, and process to become a Field partner (<a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules">Akvo partner rules page</a>).</p>
      <h3 id="whatsupport">What is a ‘Support partner’, and how do I become one? </h3>
      <p>Akvo Support partners are organizations which support the Field partners in different ways. They can supply knowledge, information, implementation support, training, and contacts. They are responsible for monitoring of project implementation and approving the project plan, and can help with writing project implementation plans, troubleshooting, networks and connections. Support partners should be well-connected within their relevant field of international development. Please refer to the full list of criteria, roles and responsibilities, and process to become a Support partner (<a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules">Akvo partner rules page</a>). </p>
      <h3 id="whatfunding">What is a ‘Funding partner’, and how do I become one? </h3>
      <p>If you want to donate money to a project in Akvo, you can become a Funding partner. This can range from individuals and groups of individuals to companies, NGO’s, government organizations, and other types of organizations. If you are an individual, you can simply donate money by clicking on the ‘Donate’ button of the project, and follow the steps there. If you represent a company, or want to make a large donation, please go the <a href="http://akvo.org/web/how_to_fund_a_project">Sponsor page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="singlefunding">Can a single organization be both Support partner and Funding partner?</h3>
      <p>Yes, this is possible, depending on the nature of the organization. Some organizations both distribute funds to Field partners, and support local projects. </p>
      <h3 id="singlefield">Can a single organization be both Field partner and Support partner? </h3>
      <p>This is not recommended. However, in some cases large organizations with a long track record may have offices in multiple countries. In such cases, a local office could function as the Field partner, and the main office would be the Support partner. An important criterion is that the partner has a local office where the project is carried out, because it needs to be able to work with the local community on an ongoing basis. </p>
      <h3 id="responsibilities">How are the responsibilities divided between Akvo and the different partner organizations?</h3>
      <p>Akvo provides a stable and secure platform which is used by the partners to facilitate communication and reporting and to secure funds for projects. Akvo collects money donated to projects and distributes it to the proper recipients. Akvo facilitates the collection of up-to-date knowledge on water and sanitation technologies on Akvopedia. Akvo actively builds a network of trusted partners which act as Support and Field partners.</p>
      <p>The Field partner is responsible for producing a good quality project plan, is responsible for the implementation of the project together with the local community, and for providing regular project updates. </p>
      <p>Support partners from the Akvo trusted partner network invite Field partners to contribute projects. Support partners back projects that they think are of good quality, and they can help putting good projects together. The Support partner and Field partner jointly put the project into the Akvo system. The Support partner provides support and monitoring of project implementation. </p>
      <p>It is up to the Support, Field and Funding partner to agree on what level of monitoring and reporting is required. Some smaller project may only require Realy Simple Reporting (RSR), while larger projects will require higher levels of monitoring. The level of monitoring should be part of the project description, so people can decide what they want to donate money to. </p>
      <p>Please refer to the full list of criteria, roles and responsibilities, and process to become a Support or Field partner (<a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules">Akvo partner rules page</a>). </p>
      <h3 id="howmany">How many partners can work together on a project? </h3>
      <p>In principle, many partners can work together on a project. There is no maximum, although a smaller number of partners is more manageable. At the minimum, the Field partner and Support partner should be different, except in very special cases (see: "Can a single organization be both Field partner and Support partner?").</p>
    </div>

       <hr class="delicate" />
<h2>Financial aspects</h2>
      <h3 id="whatcharge">Why does Akvo charge money for its services? </h3>
      <p>It costs money to develop and run Akvo.org. Sponsors and investors are subsidising the initial building of the Akvo platform, but we need to be self-sustainable in the long run. We believe this is best achieved by charging a small fee for the services which we offer. </p>
      <p>Akvo is a non-profit and we charge the smallest fee possible for the work we do. Most importantly, for Akvo to be accountable to users rather than to funders, users pay us to continue developing tools which are useful to them, rather than what funders think they need. </p>
      <p>We also believe that if people wouldn’t be willing to pay even a small fee for the Akvo tools, they are probably not worth having, and we shouldn’t be working on them. We want our customers to tell us what they need and how we can improve the value they get for their money.</p>
      <p>All Akvo pricing information is <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/fees">available here</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="akvoprices">What are the prices Akvo charges? </h3>
      <p>Akvo charges a small fee for the services we offer through the Akvo Marketplace (donation system) and the Akvo Really Simple Reporting system. Akvopedia is accessible free of charge. </p>
      <p>All Akvo pricing information is <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/fees">available here</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="northsouth">Do you have different prices for Northern and Southern-based NGO? </h3>
      <p>Yes. Southern-based NGOs typically pay half of the fee that Northern-based NGOs pay.</p>
      <h3 id="tryfree">Can I try out the Akvo services for free? </h3>
      <p>Yes. If you are an approved Field partner or Support partner, you can have access to one project for free in Akvo. You can try out both the Marketplace and the Really Simple Reporting system. </p>
      <h3 id="discount">Can we get a discount on Akvoʼs fees? </h3>
      <p>If you plan to maintain a large number of projects (50+) or large programmes (1 million Euros or more) on Akvo.org, please contact us at peter [at] akvo.org to discuss a strategic partnership. </p>
      <h3 id="programme">How does Akvo define a “project” versus a “programme”?</h3>
      <p>Akvo defines a project to be a small-scale international development project in one location, that fits within one of our focus areas - for example a water and/or sanitation project (installation, capacity building/training, education, etc). A project generally has a total budget under 35,000 Euros.</p>
      <p>A programme consists of multiple smaller components in multiple locations, typically with larger budgets and more partners involved. </p>
      <h3 id="distinction">Why does Akvo make a distinction between projects and programmes? </h3>
      <p>We try to have a fair pricing model for our partners which also is easy to understand. We donʼt think it would be fair if programmes with a budget of 300,000 Euro pay the same amount to use Akvo RSR as a project which has a budget of 3,000 Euro. </p>
      <h3 id="100percent">Does 100% of the money that is donated go to the project? </h3>
      <p>Individual donors who donate money to projects or programmes on Akvo.org do not pay any fees, and Akvo does not take a cut of the donation. Payment gateways such as Paypal or iDeal, however, may charge a percentage fee of the donation or a fixed fee. An institutional donor which donates money to a project on Akvo.org pays a fee of 2.00% on top of the donation. </p>
      <p>Akvo is working with the Rabobank to devise a payment system in which as large a share as is possible goes to the project. </p>
      <h3 id="anyonedonate">Can anyone donate money to projects? </h3>
      <p>Yes. Projects that need funds have a donate button, through which individuals can donate money. Organizations or companies that want to donate can contact Akvo directly at donations [at] akvo.org. Akvo only accepts funds from reliable and trustworthy sources. </p>
      <h3 id="systemsecure">How do I know the donation system used by Akvo is secure?</h3>
      <p>At the moment, we use PayPal and iDeal, which both are well-established and trusted payment gateways.</p>
      <p>Our partner for financial matters is the Rabobank, a large Dutch bank with AAA status and a long track record in implementing secure online payment systems. Currently, they are developing the on-line payment system, which will handle all payments. The Akvo accounts are audited every year by independent public accountants. </p>
      <h3 id="rightplace">How do I know the money goes to projects worthy of support? </h3>
      <p>All Akvo projects have both a Field partner which implements the project and a Support partner which ensures quality. Akvo pays careful attention to the selection of partners that can use the Akvo system. For an overview of the roles and responsibilities of Field and Support partners, please go to the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules">Partner rules page</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="findmoney">How can I use Akvo to find money for my project? </h3>
      <p>If you are an Akvo partner and have defined a project together with a Support partner, you can post the project on the Akvo Marketplace. Then, you can use our tools to raise funds. For example, you can place an Akvo widget on your own website, which has a donate button on it.</p>
      <h3 id="costmarketplace">What does it cost to use the Akvo Marketplace system to find money for a project?</h3>
      <p>This depends on several factors. You can find all the information on the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/fees">prices page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="costrsr">What does it cost to use the Akvo RSR system for reporting and feedback of a running project? </h3>
      <p>This depends on several factors. You can find all the information on the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/fees">prices page</a> </p>
      <h3 id="improverate">Will Akvo improve the rates of donation to my projects and why? </h3>
      <p>When your project is in the Akvo Marketplace, it is visible in many places. In addition to the Akvo website, your project can appear on websites which make use of Akvo widgets to show a selection of projects. This can be your own website, a Support partner website, external fundraising websites, etc. </p>
      <p>Secondly, putting your project in Akvo Marketplace is the easiest way to get a ‘Donate’ button on your project. Setting up an online payment system represents a significant overhead for small organizations, and is therefore often not feasible. With Akvo Marketplace, you get full donation functionality for only a small fee. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, money usually does not drop from the sky. Therefore, it is very important that you use the Akvo tools in the optimal way, to increase the chance that your project attracts funds. Akvo provides helpful information on how to do this. </p>
    </div>

       <hr class="delicate" />
<h2>The Akvo Marketplace</h2>
      <h3 id="whatmarketplace">What is the Akvo Marketplace?</h3>
      <p>The Akvo Marketplace showcases development aid projects, including many that are still unfunded (or part-funded). Organisations, companies and individuals looking to fund a project use it to learn about project goals, affected communities, plans for maintaining facilities and/or sustaining impact, and more. Akvo collects the funds and channels them to the Support partner.</p>
      <p>You can showcase a project on your website too by embedding an <a href=http://www.akvo.org/web/faq_activities_and_services#whatwidget>Akvo widget.</a></p>
      <h3 id="howlong">How long does it usually take for a project to attract funds?</h3>
      <p>Current active projects in the Akvo Marketplace have taken anywhere from a week to half a year to attract funding. </p>
      <p>Posting a project on Akvo Marketplace is an opportunity to raise funds, not a guarantee. Partners still need to figure out the best way our tools can be used to draw attention and attract funding to their project, and how to best present it to funders. We'll share new ways for attracting funds via Akvo as they develop.</p>
      <p>Akvo has strategic partnerships in place with organisations and companies that structurally use our platform to fund projects of their choice.</p>
      <h3 id="getmoney">If my project is completely funded, how do I get the money? </h3>
      <p>The money is transferred by the Netherlands-based Rabobank to the support partner's local bank, who then manages the transfer of the money to the field partner. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <hr class="delicate" />
<h2>Reporting on projects with Really Simple Reporting</h2>
      <h3 id="whatisrsr">What is Really Simple Reporting? </h3>
      <p>Akvo Really Simple Reporting is a web- and SMS-based reporting system that allows partners that work on projects to easily share short text updates, images and movie clips. RSR is an easy and transparent way to track projects in the field on a regular basis, and to share and visualise results in an appealing way. One of the benefits is the increased transparency from publishing all the project details including funds, deliverables, and updates, on a freely accessible website.</p>
      <p>Each project in the system gets its own webpage, on which the updates (text, photo or video) of the project can be placed through a web interface. The updates function as a blog, reporting on the progress of the project. At the moment, we are piloting a system to send updates to the website though SMS, which can be used from places without internet access. </p>
      <p>In addition to the updates, the project page contains other information on the project, such as background, planning information, a gallery with photos and videos, etc.</p>
      <p>Donors and fundraisers can follow project progress online and can showcase project developments automatically in their own websites using <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/faq_activities_and_services#whatwidget">Akvo Widgets</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="howusesms">How can I use SMS as a reporting tool?</h3>
      <p>We are piloting a system to use SMS to send messages and photos directly to the project webpage. Say you are giving a training in the field on how to drill a well. The update could then be a short description of what is taking place and the progress that has been made that day. When the SMS is sent, within a few minutes the update will be published on the project webpage. </p>
      <h3 id="howreport">How can I use Akvo tools to report on ongoing projects?</h3>
      <p>Using the Akvo Really Simple Reporting tool, you can post pictures, text updates and short movies using a web interface. Soon, you will be able to use SMS to send updates to the project webpage. As an example, have a look at the updates at <a href="http://www.akvo.org/rsr/project/16/">this project in Madagascar</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="whichparnter">Which partner is responsible for entering project updates on Akvo? </h3>
      <p>This can be decided between the Field and Support partners. Updates should preferably come from the Field partner, as they are the ones implementing the project. </p>
      <h3 id="whoupdates">Who can make an update on a project? </h3>
      <p>Anyone who has an Akvo RSR account and who is associated to a particular project in the capacity of Field partner or Support partner can make updates on that particular project. Funding partners can post updates as well.</p>
      <h3 id="whocomments">Who can comment on a project? </h3>
      <p>At the moment, anyone who is an Akvo partner and who has created an account can comment on all projects. The comments are shown on a separate section of the project page. </p>
      <h3 id="extraburden">Isn't reporting via RSR an extra burden on NGOs which are already overburdened with reporting requirements?</h3>
      <p>We are not trying to create an additional layer of reporting. We are trying to make simple tools that make it possible to move some of the reporting that is already happening to a place where more people can follow it, and where it can be more useful. As the RSR tools are easy to use, this does not add an extra burden - on the contrary, it will safe time of field staff. </p>
      <h3 id="howoften">If my project is in the Akvo system, how often do I need to provide updates? </h3>
      <p>This can be decided between the different project partners, but we ask that as a minimum, updates are given at least every two weeks. As a typical update consists of a single or a few paragraphs of text and a picture, this should be relatively light task. If the project is stopped for some reason, this is also valid information - you could say why the project is on hold, what the status is, and what will happen in the future. </p>
      <h3 id="howmanypeople">How many people from my organization can use Akvo? </h3>
      <p>As many as you like. Organizations using the Akvo tools pay per project, not per user.</p>
      <h3 id="goeswrong">What happens if something goes wrong with my project? </h3>
      <p>If something goes wrong with the project and you are the Field partner, explain what went wrong, what was done to fix it, and what the outcome was. In such a case, the project should at least be a learning experience for others. For transparency, we never delete projects from the Akvo system. </p>
      <h3 id="editinfo">Can I edit project information? </h3>
      <p>Yes, if you are the Field partner or Support partner of a project. We are currently refining the rights of who can edit what, and to which degree the history of a project is editable. </p>
      <h3 id="whatcancel">What happens if I want to cancel an active project or programme?</h3>
      <p>Canceling a project is not a lightweight decision, especially if funds were received from donors. If there are sufficiently important reasons why a project must be canceled, an update explaining why the project has been canceled should be entered so others can learn from your experience. </p>
      <p>Although a project can be canceled, we never delete a project from Akvo.org. The principle is that once a project has been entered into Akvo, it should never be removed. This is for the sake of transparency and continued learning.</p>
      <p>When you cancel an active project or programme, any related Akvo fees cease. </p>
      <h3 id="whatstop">What happens if I want to stop using Akvo? </h3>
      <p>You can stop using the Akvo services for your projects or programmes at any time. However, for transparency, we never delete projects from the Akvo system. </p>
      <h3 id="uploadany">People could upload any picture in an update and say "This is our new pump". How do you know they are telling the truth? </h3>
      <p>This question holds equally true for Akvo RSR as for conventional types of reporting. It is both a matter of trust and of adequate monitoring. Akvo works with a trusted network of Support partners, which is carefully build up with organizations which are part of the international water and sanitation network, both through personal contacts and a thorough vetting process. Support partners recommend and support Field partners that they have a trust relationship with.</p>
      <p>The monitoring is carried out by the Support partner. In some cases, projects make use of reporting by external parties, such as an independent journalist or reporter. In the ideal case, independent local video reporters visit projects to report on them, both before the project starts and after the project ends. A number of projects in Akvo are already reported on in this way by reporters of <a href="http://www.africa-interactive.net/">Africa Interactive</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="followup">How do you follow up on projects that are completed? Many projects fail a year or two after implementation. </h3>
      <p>In many cases, Support and Funding partners follow up on projects that are completed. Akvo does not mandate how projects should be followed up, but we encourage that it is done. Completed projects are stored for free on the Akvo system and updates from follow-up visits to projects can still be posted to the project. </p>
    </div>

       <hr class="delicate" />
<h2>Sharing knowledge - Akvopedia</h2>
      <h3 id="whatakvopedia">What is Akvopedia?</h3>
      <p>Akvopedia works just like Wikipedia. It is filled with information on smart and affordable water and sanitation technology in rural or urban settings. Anyone can contribute knowledge and edit Akvopedia. Local field workers get access to new ideas for their projects, and can share knowledge in new ways. For those with good content but who are short of time to share it, Akvopedia offers free editorial services.</p>
      <h3 id="contributeakvopedia">How to contribute to Akvopedia </h3>
      <p>We use the same conventions as the well-known online resource Wikipedia, so adding and editing articles is quick and easy to learn. To get started, first create an Akvopedia user account using the Log in/create account link in the upper right corner of the <a href="http://www.akvopedia.org">Akvopedia home page</a>. Then use this <a href="http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Editing_an_Akvopedia_page">graphical guide</a> to get started creating and editing articles. More detailed information about editing wiki articles can be found on our <a href="http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Help:Contents">help pages</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="qualcontrol">How is quality control done? </h3>
      <p>Akvopedia draws on the combined knowledge of many water and sanitation experts from around the world. We actively engage experts to contribute new and check existing information. All changes to the Akvopedia are reviewed weekly by our Akvopedia editor.</p>
      <h3 id="languages">What about other languages? </h3>
      <p>At the moment the Akvopedia is only available in English. Having it available in more languages is one of our priorities, and we are currently figuring out the best way to handle translations.</p>
      <h3 id="whyakvopedia">Why use Akvopedia instead of Wikipedia or Appropedia? </h3>
      <p>Akvopedia is an integrated part of the whole Akvo system: projects link to relevant Akvopedia articles, and Akvopedia articles will (eventually) link back to relevant projects. For that to work, the structure of the Akvopedia portals needs to be stable. We couldn't guarantee that if we depended on another knowledge sharing platform.</p>
      <p>We also have certain ideas on how best to structure water and sanitation information. Taking a systems approach, we've given our articles on individual technologies a uniform structure and quality. If all articles have similar structure, readers can more easily and quickly find what they need.</p>
      <p>This having been said, all Akvopedia content is licensed as open source. Just as we use material from others, all are welcome to read and reuse our material.</p>

<h2>Interacting with the Akvo website/system</h2>
      <h3 id="limitedaccess">Akvo seems to be web-based. What if local access to internet is limited? </h3>
      <p>Akvo is internet based, but in order to be useful, partners don't need to have internet access all the time. As long as partner organisations have access to internet occasionally, such as in an internet cafe, they can use the Akvo tools. Project information can be entered in PDF forms, which can be filled in off-line, and be send to Akvo through email at a convenient time.</p>
      <p>We are working on mobile phone-based tools that will allow people to do reporting and other types of interactions with the Akvo system. In the future, some of the tools may be made available off-line as well.</p>
      <h3 id="linkexternal">Can I include links to external web sites within Akvo? </h3>
      <p>Yes you can. Links can be embedded in the project pages, and one can link to external pages in the Akvopedia pages.</p>
      <h3 id="batches">Can I upload batches of projects at one time? </h3>
      <p>Not at the moment. Projects need to be entered one by one. </p>
      <h3 id="api">Can I access my data directly through an Application Programme Interface (API)? </h3>
      <p>A beta test of the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/labs/index.php/Akvo_RSR_API">Akvo RSR API</a> has been released. The API can publish information about projects and updates using either XML or JSON. Before writing applications using the Akvo RSR API, please read the <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/akvo-rsr-api-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="hostfiles">Does Akvo host files and video? </h3>
      <p>At the moment, no. We plan to host files in the future. For video, there are already good places on the web that host video, such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://blip.tv/">blip.tv</a>, and <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>. Videos from these sites can be embedded in Akvo project pages. Akvo hosts files on blip.tv, which can be found at <a href="http://akvo.tv">akvo.tv</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="deletecompleted">Are projects deleted on Akvo after they are completed? </h3>
      <p>No. In the interest of transparency and continued learning, projects on Akvo are never removed. </p>
      <h3 id="getwidget">How do I get a widget? </h3>
      <p>On each project page, there is a page tool called ‘Get widget’, which allows you to create the HTML embedding code for the widget, which you can then put in your own website. You can customize the colour and which projects you want to show. Standard widgets are free, advanced widgets are only available for Akvo partners, who pay a small fee for the Akvo RSR services. </p>
      <h3 id="howmanyusers">How many people from my organization can use Akvo? </h3>
      <p>You can have as many user accounts as you want on the Akvo system. Fees are charged per project, not per user.</p>
      <h3 id="accessssytem">How can I access the Akvo system? Do I need to install software? </h3>
      <p>You can simply access the Akvo website with a standard web browser. There, you can log in to the Akvo tools, such as the Marketplace and RSR. You don't need to install any software.</p>
      <h3 id="pooldata">Will Akvo pool my data with that of other organizations? Who owns the information in the Akvo system? </h3>
      <p>All the information on Akvopedia is published under an open source license, and reuse is permitted according to the terms in that license. </p>
      <p>The information in the Akvo RSR and the Akvo Marketplace is owned by the originators, which are the Field Partner and Support partner. Any reuse of project information such as project descriptions, background descriptions, photos and movies, is subject to the permission of the originator of the material. Akvo will use the data from the projects in an aggregate form, such as the average duration of projects, average cost per person for water and sanitation systems, etc. We might pass that data on in an open format so others can use it as well.</p>
      <p>You can find detailed <a href="http://www.akvo.org/web/terms_of_use">terms of use here</a>. </p>
      <h3 id="keepprivate">Can I keep some of my project data private on Akvo? </h3>
      <p>At the moment, no. All the information is accessible to all. As we have received several requests to change this, we are reviewing the need for a private section. </p>
      <h3 id="acknowledge">Do I need to acknowledge Akvo in any formal way when I use the Akvo system? </h3>
      <p>If you reuse information from Akvopedia on your website or in a different form, you should reference the source of the material to Akvo, and link to the appropriate license page. If you use a widget, there is an Akvo link on the widget automatically. If anyone wants to copy information from projects, such as text, photos or video, they should ask permission to the Field partner and/or Support partner, as they are the owner of the information. </p>
