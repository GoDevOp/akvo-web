###  Seeithappen 'all projects' map

The current JSON plugin only caches "all" data it pulls, it has no
concept of a permanent cache that updates with new data.

As the Akvo RSR v3 API now only allows 10 per fetch  we have had to remove the map on http://akvo.org/seeithappen until we can update the new JSON plugin with long term cache management.
